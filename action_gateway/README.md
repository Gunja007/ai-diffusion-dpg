# Action Gateway DPG

The framework's only interface with the external world. All external API calls go through this service.

---

## What this service does

The Action Gateway executes external API calls on behalf of the LLM. The LLM expresses intent by returning a `tool_use` block — it never calls external systems directly. Agent Core detects the tool request, routes it to the Action Gateway, and feeds the normalised result back into the conversation.

For the PoC, this is a mock FastAPI server (`mock_server.py`) that returns hardcoded fixture data for the ONEST market lookup API. The fixture data mirrors what the real ONEST API would return for the Hubli labour market.

**Write connector rule:** Any connector of type `write` or `identity` requires explicit user consent via the Trust Layer before execution. The PoC only includes a `read` connector (market lookup), so no consent flow is triggered.

## HTTP API

The mock server runs on port **9999**.

### `POST /onest/market_lookup`

Returns labour market data (salary range, demand signal, top employers) for a given trade and location.

This endpoint simulates the real ONEST network API. In production, this call would go to the live ONEST marketplace.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "trade": "electrician",
  "location": "Hubli",
  "distance_km": 50
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "trade": "electrician",
  "salary_range": "₹15k–₹28k",
  "market_signal": "steady signal 12% QoQ",
  "top_employers": ["Hubli Distribution Co", "Karnataka Power"],
  "source": "ONEST"
}
```

## Fixture data (PoC)

The mock server returns hardcoded responses for three trades. Any other trade name returns the default fixture.

| Trade | Salary Range | Market Signal | Top Employers |
|---|---|---|---|
| `electrician` | ₹15k–₹28k | steady signal 12% QoQ | Hubli Distribution Co, Karnataka Power |
| `welder` | ₹13k–₹22k | 8% QoQ | Hubli Iron Works, Dharwad Fabrication |
| `fitter` | ₹14k–₹24k | 10% QoQ | BEML Hubli, KA Manufacturing |
| *(any other)* | ₹12k–₹20k | stable | — |

Trade matching is **case-insensitive** (e.g. `Electrician`, `ELECTRICIAN`, `electrician` all match).

## Tool definition (as seen by the LLM)

Agent Core loads this tool definition from config and sends it to the LLM on every turn. The LLM uses it to decide when to call market lookup:

```yaml
connectors:
  read:
    - name: onest_market_lookup
      description: "Look up current salary range and demand for a trade in a location"
      parameters:
        trade:
          type: string
          description: "Occupation or trade (e.g. electrician, welder, fitter)"
        location:
          type: string
          description: "City or district"
        distance_km:
          type: integer
          description: "Search radius in kilometres (default 50)"
```

---

## Configuration

| Key | Description |
|---|---|
| `connector.endpoint` | URL of the ONEST mock server (default: `http://localhost:9999/onest/market_lookup`) |
| `connector.timeout_s` | Request timeout for market lookup calls (default: 5s) |

## Dependencies

```
fastapi   >= 0.110
uvicorn   >= 0.29
pydantic  >= 2.0
pyyaml    >= 6.0
httpx     >= 0.27    # Used by mock_gateway.py to call the mock server
```

Requires Python 3.11+.

## Adding new connectors

To add a new external connector (e.g. a scheme application API):

1. Add a new endpoint to `mock_server.py` with the mock response (or point to a real API).
2. Add the connector definition to `agent_core/config/config.yaml` under `connectors.read` or `connectors.write`.
3. If it is a `write` connector, it will automatically require user consent via the Trust Layer — no code changes needed.
4. The LLM will pick up the new tool definition on next startup and use it when appropriate.
