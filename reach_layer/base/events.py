"""
reach_layer/base/events.py

Lightweight event dataclasses for SSE events received from Agent Core.

These mirror Agent Core's StreamEvent types but are independently defined
to keep reach_layer decoupled from agent_core's internal models. The base
class parses SSE JSON into these objects so channel implementations can
render them without coupling to Agent Core internals.
